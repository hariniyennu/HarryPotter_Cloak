# HarryPotter_Cloak
This project creates an invisibility effect inspired by the Harry Potter series. By leveraging a webcam and image processing techniques, it makes a person or object "disappear" when covered by a specific color (red in this case). The background replaces the region covered by the cloak, creating the illusion of invisibility.
